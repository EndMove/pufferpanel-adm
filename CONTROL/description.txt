[IMPORTANT WARNING]: If you are building/starting a resource-intensive game server, make sure your Server/NAS has adequate resources. If not, Docker Engine is likely to consume all your server's resources and render it unreachable. In this type of situation, you have two solutions: (1) wait for the situation to stabilise or (2) restart the server. WARNING: PULLING THE PLUG IS NOT A SOLUTION. Instead, use the 'reboot' command via SSH or the ADM interface.
[UNINSTALL WARNING]: If you choose to uninstall the application, all data relating to it will be automatically deleted. Don't forget to backup :-).
